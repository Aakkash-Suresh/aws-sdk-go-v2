// Package sfn provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Step Functions.
//
// # Step Functions
//
// With Step Functions, you can create workflows, also called state machines, to
// build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices,
// and create data and machine learning pipelines.
//
// Through the Step Functions API, you can create, list, update, and delete state
// machines, activities, and other data types. You can start, stop, and redrive
// your state machines. Your activity workers can send task success, heartbeat, and
// failure responses.
//
// With API calls, you can also manage other aspects of your workflow, such as
// tags, versions, and aliases.
//
// For more information about developing solutions with Step Functions, see the [Step Functions Developer Guide] .
//
// If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK
// integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names
// are in Pascal case. For example, you might use Step Functions API action
// startSyncExecution and specify its parameter as StateMachineArn .
