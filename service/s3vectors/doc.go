// Package s3vectors provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon S3 Vectors.
//
// Amazon S3 vector buckets are a bucket type to store and search vectors with
// sub-second search times. They are designed to provide dedicated API operations
// for you to interact with vectors to do similarity search. Within a vector
// bucket, you use a vector index to organize and logically group your vector data.
// When you make a write or read request, you direct it to a single vector index.
// You store your vector data as vectors. A vector contains a key (a name that you
// assign), a multi-dimensional vector, and, optionally, metadata that describes a
// vector. The key uniquely identifies the vector in a vector index.
